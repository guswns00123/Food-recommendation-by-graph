my girlfriend learned this authentic recipe while living in italy for several years. it’s simple, but takes a lot of time and a lot of love, but its well worth the effort! this is for your free saturday or sunday when you will be in the house for the day. 

add more tomatoes, garlic, or basil if you wish. there really is no set amount for each of these, but i do suggest a minimum of 10 whole red ripe tomatoes, and a minimum of 5 garlic cloves. add some crushed red pepper to give it a kick if you wish. 

this recipe is the rundown of how i make the sauce now. it took me several attempts to really master this, but once you get it down you can make more tomatoes at a time. i usually work with two pots and start out with 10 in each pot, skin all the tomatoes in both, combine and start more in the empty pot to really make a large pot to freeze. the local vegetable stand sells 25 lb. baskets for $9 while in season. we do 50 lbs. a week for a month, so we can freeze and have great sauce all during the winter.
