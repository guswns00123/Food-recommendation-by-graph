the dish is a primary staple throughout much of algeria, morocco, tunisia, and libya . it is also popular in the west african sahel, in france, madeira island, in western sicily's trapani province, and parts of the middle east. it is particularly popular among jews of north african descent, such as the berber jews, and is eaten in many other parts of the world as well.","['water', 'israeli couscous', 'olive oil', 'salt', 'kidney beans', 'red bell pepper', 'green bell pepper', 'onion', 'cilantro', 'flat leaf parsley', 'red pepper', 'honey', 'lime, juice of', 'virgin olive oil']",16,,"['2   cups    water (or vegetable broth)', '1   cup    israeli couscous', '1   teaspoon    olive oil', '1/2  teaspoon    kosher salt', '1 1/2  cups    kidney beans, rinsed and drained  (or black beans)', '3/4  cup   chopped red bell pepper', '3/4  cup   chopped green bell pepper', '1/4  cup   chopped red onion', '3       green onions, chopped ', '1/2  cup   chopped fresh cilantro', '1/4  cup   chopped fresh flat leaf parsley', '1/4-1/2  teaspoon    red pepper flakes (optional)', '1   tablespoon    honey', '1      large lime, juice of', '3   tablespoons    extra virgin olive oil', '  salt and pepper']",9.0,0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,0,0,9,5.0,5.0
