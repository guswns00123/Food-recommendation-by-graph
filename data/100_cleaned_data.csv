for those not familiar with thai food, chicken satay consists of marinated strips of chicken breast, skewered, grilled and served with a delicious, somewhat spicy, peanut sauce. they are ubiquitous not only in thai restaurants in the us, but in thailand itself - where they are sold by street vendors for ridiculously low prices. 
when we visited thailand, we were amazed at how much the food served there tasted like the food served at thai restaurants in america. this is not always the case - cambodian food in the us, for example, rarely resembles what's available there. i don't know if this is because thai recipes have become standardized, or because the basic ingredients produce dishes of similar taste regardless of proportions or other ingredients. in any case, we found that this recipe for chicken satay produced a dish that tasted pretty much exactly like the chicken satay served at thai restaurants here and in thailand. needless to say, it was very good. 
you should be able to buy the necessary ingredients at specialized asian markets. thai red curry was not available at my local safeway, but i could find it easily at a local asian market. note that fish sauce usually comes in huge bottles, you only need a little bit, so try to buy the smallest size you can. the stuff is very smelly, but wonderful when mixed with the other ingredients. 
for my party, i tripled the recipe i'm including here. this was fine for the chicken itself, but it produced way too much peanut sauce. one recipe of peanut sauce would have been enough.","['chicken', 'coconut milk', 'fish sauce', 'red curry paste', 'sugar', 'cilantro', 'turmeric', 'black pepper', 'bamboo skewer']",9,thai,"['1   lb    boneless skinless chicken breast', '1/2  cup    coconut milk', '1   tablespoon    fish sauce', '2   teaspoons    red curry paste', '1   teaspoon    palm sugar or 1   teaspoon    brown sugar', '1   tablespoon   chopped cilantro', '1/2  teaspoon    ground turmeric', '  salt & freshly ground black pepper', '  bamboo skewer, soaked in cold water ']",0.9,98,"[202.65, 12.24, 9.18, 18.37, 55.1, 31.63, 1.02]",202.65,12.24,9.18,18.37,55.1,31.63,847.8876,1D,15,15,0,4.5,4.5
