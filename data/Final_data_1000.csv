as the other zaar recipes have done, ""cooking time"" is actually chilling time.

beware of the garlic in this recipe -- it packs a definite punch! my source recommends making a gazpacho blanco and a red gazpacho and serving them in small glasses so everyone gets one of each for the different flavors ...

i usually make it about the same, but depending on what i have on hand, or might feel like mixing things up, it will be slightly different every time.  feel free to add, subtract, or alter it to your own personal tastes!  --------

i usually use frozen egg noodles, but today, i made them from scratch, using this recipe.  http://www.recipezaar.com/delicious-homemade-egg-noodles-95311  --------

i also used my own homemade chicken stock that i made from a roasted chicken a few days ago!  i did this by taking the leftover carcass, and simmering it in a large pot of water, with some onion, carrots, celery, salt and pepper for several hours.  after it cooled down, i strained out the chicken bits and veggies, and stored the stock in the fridge.  when i was ready to use it, i was able to skim the hardened fat off the top and throw it away.   i ended up with about 4 cups of stock!  --------
